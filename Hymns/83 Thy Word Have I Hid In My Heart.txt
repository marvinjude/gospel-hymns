Thy Word is a lamp to my feet;
A light to my path always;
To guide and to save me from sin,
And show me the heavenly way.

    Thy Word have I hid in my heart…
    That I might not sin against thee…
    That I might not sin, that I might not sin,
    Thy Word have I hid in my heart.

For ever o Lord is Thy Word
Established and fixed on high;
Thy faithfulness to all men
Abideth for ever nigh.

At morning, at noon, and at night
I ever will give Thee praise;
For Thou art my portion, O Lord,
And shall be though all my days!

Through Him whom Thy Word hath foretold,
The Saviour and Morning Star,
Salvation and peace have been brought
To those who have strayed afar.

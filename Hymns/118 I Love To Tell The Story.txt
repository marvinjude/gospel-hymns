I love to tell the story 
of unseen things above,
of Jesus and his glory, 
of Jesus and his love.
I love to tell the story 
because I know 'tis true;
it satisfies my longings 
as nothing else could do.

    I love to tell the story! 
    'twill be my theme in glory
    to tell the old, old story 
    of Jesus and his love.

I love to tell the story; 
more wonderful it seems
than all the golden fancies 
of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story, 
it did so much for me;
and that is just the reason 
I tell it now to thee.

I love to tell the story; 
'tis pleasant to repeat
what seems, each time I tell it, 
more wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story, 
for some have never heard
the message of salvation 
from God's own holy Word. 

I love to tell the story, 
for those who know it best
seem hungering and thirsting 
to hear it like the rest.
And when in scenes of glory 
I sing the new, new song,
'twill be the old, old story
that I have loved so long.

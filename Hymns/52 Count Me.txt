When you count the ones who love the Lord,
Count me, count me;
When you count up those who trust His Word,
Count me, count me.

    Count me with the children of the heavenly King;
    Count me with the servants who would service bring;
    Count me with the ransomed who His praises sing;
    Count me… count me…

When you count up those who 're saved by grace,
Count me, count me;
Who have found in Christ a hiding place,
Count me, count me.

When you count up those who do the right,
Count me, count me;
Who are walking in the Gospel light
Count me, count me.

When you count up those who forward press,
Count me, count me;
Who shall gain the crown of righteousness,
Count me, count me.

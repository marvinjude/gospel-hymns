Sing a song, spread some cheer,
There are sad and lonely people ev'rywhere;
Be a friend, show some love,
It will lift them from the dungeons of despair.

    Show a little bit of love and kindness,
    Never go along with hatred's blindness,
    Take a little time to reach for joy and wear a happy face;
    Sing a little bit when the days are dreary,
    Give a little help to a friend who's weary 
    That's the way to make the world a happy place.

Offer help, bring some hope,
To the fainting and discouraged on life's road;
See a need, lend a hand,
There are many who are crushed beneath their load.

Be a light, show the way,
Be a light within the night for those astray;
Speak a word, loving word,
That will bring them back to walk the narrow way.

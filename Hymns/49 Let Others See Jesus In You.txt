While passing through this world of sin,
And others your life shall view;
Be clean and pure without, within,
Let others see Jesus in you.

    Let others see Jesus in you…
    Let others see Jesus in you…;
    Keep telling the story, be faithful and true,
    Let others see Jesus in you.

Your life's a book before their eyes,
They're reading it through and through;
Say, does it point them to the skies,
Do others see Jesus in you?

What joy 'twill be at set of sun,
In mansions beyond the blue,
To find some souls that you have won;
Let others see Jesus in you.

Then live for Christ both day and night,
Be faithful, be brave and true,
And lead the lost to life and light;
Let others see Jesus in you.

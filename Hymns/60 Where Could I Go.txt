Living below in this old sinful world,
Hardly a comfort can afford;
Striving alone to face temptations sore,
Where could I go but to the Lord?

    Where could I go, O where could I go,
    Seeking a refuge for my soul?
    Needing a friend to save me in the end,
    Where could I go but to the Lord?

Neighbours are kind, I love them every one,
We get along in sweet accord;
But when my soul needs manna from above,
Where could I go but to the Lord?

Life here is grand with friends I love so dear,
Comfort I get from God's own word;
Yet when I face the chilling hand of death,
Where could I go but to the Lord?

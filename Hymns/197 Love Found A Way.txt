Wonderful love that rescued me, 
Sunk deep in sin,
Guilty and vile as I could be
No hope within;
When ev'ry ray of light had fled, 
O glorious day!
Raising my soul from out the dead, 
Love found a way.

    Love found a way to redeem my soul,
    Love found a way that could make me whole;
    Love sent my Lord to the cross of shame,
    Love found a way, O praise His holy name!

Love bro't my Saviour here to die 
On Calvary,
For such a sinful wretch as I,
How can it be?
Love bridged the gulf 'twixt me and Heav'n, 
Taught me to pray;
I am redeemed, set free, forgiv'n,
Love found a way. 

Love opened wide the gates of light 
To Heav'n's domain,
Where in eternal pow'r and might 
Jesus shall reign;
Love lifted me from depths of woe 
To endless day,
There was no help in earth below,
Love found a way.

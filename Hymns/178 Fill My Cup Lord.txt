Like the woman at the well I was seeking –
For things that could not satisfy;
And then I heard my Saviour speaking –
"Draw from My well that never shall run dry."

    Fill my cup, Lord; I lift it up, Lord!
    Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
    Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more-
    Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!

There are millions in this world who are craving – 
The pleasures earthly things afford;
But none can match the wondrous treasure – 
That I find in Jesus Christ, my Lord.

So, my brother, if the things this world gave you –
Leave hungers that won't pass away,
My blessed Lord will come and save you
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:

Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary.

    Mercy there was great and grace was free,
    Pardon there was multiplied to me;
    There my burden'd soul found liberty,
    At Calvary.

By God's word at last my sin I learned,
Then I trembl'd at the law I'd spurn'd,
Till my guilty soul, imploring turned
To Calvary.

Now I've given to Jesus everything;
Now I gladly own Him as my King;
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary.

Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary!

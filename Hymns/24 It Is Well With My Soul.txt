When peace like a river attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

    It is well . . . with my soul . . .
    It is well, it is well with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin - oh the bliss of this glorious thought -
My sin - not in part, but the whole -
Is nailed to His cross: and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live!
If Jordan above me shall roll;
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal:
Oh, trump of the angel! oh, voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope! Blessed rest of my soul!

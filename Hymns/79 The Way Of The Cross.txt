I must needs go home by the way of the cross,
There's no other way but this; 
I shall ne'er get sight of the Gates of Light, 
If the way of the cross I miss.

    The way of the cross leads home,
    The way of the cross leads home
    It is sweet to know, as I onward go,
    The way of the cross leads home.

I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way,
The path that the Saviour trod, 
If I ever climb to the heights sublime, 
Where the soul is at home with God.

Then I bid farewell to the way of the world, 
To walk in it never more; 
For my Lord says "Come" and seek my home,
Where He waits at the open door.

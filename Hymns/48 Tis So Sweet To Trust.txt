'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word;
Just to lean upon His promise,
Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

    Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him,
    How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!
    Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
    O for grace to trust Him more!

O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
Just in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus –
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace!

I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end.

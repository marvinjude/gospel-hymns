I was once a sinner, but I came
Pardon to receive from my Lord:
This was freely given, and I found
That He always kept His word. 

    There's a new name written down in glory,
    And it's mine, O yes, it's mine!
    And the white robed angels sing the story,
    "A sinner has come home."
    For there's a new name written down in glory,
    And it's mine, O yes, it's mine!
    With my sins forgiven I am bound for Heaven,
    Never more to roam. 

I was humbly kneeling at the cross,
Fearing naught but God's angry frown;
When the heavens opened and I saw
That my name was written down! 

In the Book 'tis written, "Saved by Grace,"
O the joy that came to my soul!
Now I am forgiven, and I know
By the blood I am made whole!

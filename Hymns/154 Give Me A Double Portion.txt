Long ago in days of old, stood a man of God we're told,
As he talked to Elijah that day;
His request he did repeat, standing at Elijah's feet,
"A double portion" I can hear him say.

    Give me, Lord, a double portion, pour Thy Spirit on me,
    Thru eyes of faith Thy wondrous works I can see,
    But I need Thy helping hand, in this troubled, sinful land,
    Give me, Lord, a double portion from Thee.

As Elijah stood that day, to Elisha he did say,
"Ask me what I shall do unto thee,"
And Elisha then replied, walking at Elijah's side,
"A double portion, let it fall on me."

Lord, I always to Thee, pray, just for strength from day to day,
But I see there's so much to be done,
That I have to kneel anew and this favor ask of you,
A double portion -- this fight must be won.

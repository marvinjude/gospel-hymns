Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us for ever,
Makes the trusting heart His home.

    Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
    What assurance in my soul !
    On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me,
    How the billows cease to roll.

Bringing life, and health, and gladness,
All around this heav'nly Guest;
Banish'd unbelief and sadness,
Chang'd our weariness to rest.

Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming on us from on high.

What a wonderful salvation,
Where we always see His face;
What a perfect habitation,
What a quiet resting-place.

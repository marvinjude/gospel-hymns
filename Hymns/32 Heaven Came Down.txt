O what a wonderful, wonderful day –
Day I will never forget;
After I'd wandered in darkness away,
Jesus my Saviour I met;
O what a tender, compassionate Friend –
He met the need of my heart;
Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling,
He made all the darkness depart!

    Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
    When at the cross the Saviour made me whole;
    My sins were washed away
    And my night was turned to day –
    Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's fam'ly divine,
Justified fully thru Calvary's love
O what a standing is mine!
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came,
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer –
He saved me, O praise His dear name.

Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time;
I have a future in heaven for sure,
There in those mansions sublime;
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed;
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received.

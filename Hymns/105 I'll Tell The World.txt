I'll tell the world that I'm a Christian –
I'm not ashamed His name to bear;
I'll tell the world that I'm a Christian,
I'll take Him with me anywhere;
I'll tell the world how Jesus saved me,
And how He gave me a life brand-new;
And I know that if you trust Him,
That all He gave me He'll give to you;
I'll tell the world that He's my Saviour,
No other one could love me so;
My life my all is His for ever,
And where He leads me I will go.

I'll tell the world that He is coming-
It may be near or far away;
But we must live as if His coming
Shall be tomorrow or today;
For when He comes and life is over,
For those who love Him there's more to be;
Eyes have never seen the wonders
That He's preparing for you and me;
O tell the world that you're a Christian,
Be not ashamed His name to bear;
O tell the world that you're a Christian,
And take Him with you ev'rywhere.

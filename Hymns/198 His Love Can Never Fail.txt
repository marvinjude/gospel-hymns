1 I do not ask to see the way
My feet will have to tread;
But only that my soul may feed
Upon the living bread.
'Tis better far that I should walk
By faith close to His side, 
I may not know the way I go,
But oh, I know my Guide. 

    His love can never fail,
    His love can never fail;
    My soul is satisfied to know
    His love can never fail.

2 And if my feet would go astray,
They cannot, for I know
That Jesus guides my falt'ring steps,
As joyfully I go.
And tho' I may not see His face,
My faith is strong and clear
That in each hour of sore distress,
My Savior will be near.

3 I will not fear, tho' darkness come
Abroad o'er all the land,
If I may only feel the touch
Of His own loving hand.
And tho' I tremble when I think
How weak I am, how frail,
My soul is satisfied to know
His love can never fail.

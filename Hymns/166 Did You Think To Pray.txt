Ere you left your room this morning
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ, our Saviour,
Did you sue for loving favour,
As a shield today?

    O how praying rests the weary!
    Prayer will change the night to day;
    So when life seems dark and dreary,
    Don't forget to pray.

When you met with great temptation
Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As your guide and stay?

When your heart was filled with anger
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who had crossed your way?

When sore trials came upon you
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was bowed in sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates today?

Master, the tempest is raging!
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh:
"Careth not Thou not that we perish?"
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

    "The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
    Peace, be still!"
    Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
    Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
    No water can swallow the ship where lies
    The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
    They all shall sweetly obey My will;
    Peace, be still! Peace, be still!
    They all shall sweetly obey My will:
    Peace, peace, be still!

Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in my grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
O waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul!
And I perish! I perish, dear Master;
O hasten, and take control!

Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast,
Linger, O blessed Redeemer,
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbour,
And rest on the blissful shore.

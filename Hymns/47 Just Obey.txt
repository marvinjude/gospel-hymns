Just as God who reigns on high
Spake to men in days gone by;
So the Lord is calling men today;
And, my brother, this is true,
Whatsoe'er He says to you,
There is but one thing to do -
Just obey.

    Just obey . . ., just obey . . .,
    Is the way . . ., God's way . . .,
    When His message comes to you,
    There is but one thing to do:
    Just obey . . . just obey.

If you're in the Saviour's hands,
You must do as He commands,
For there is no other gospel way;
Never put the message by,
Never stop to reason, "why?"
When the Saviour speaks to you -
Just obey.

If for mansions fair you sigh,
In that land beyond the sky,
After time with you has pass'd away;
Though the way you may not see,
Christ is calling, "Follow me,"
Faith and duty both will cry -
Just obey.

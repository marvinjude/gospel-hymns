Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long,
While there are others living about us,
Never molested tho' in the wrong.

    Farther along we'll know all about it,
    Farther along we'll understand why;
    Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
    We'll understand it all by and by.

When death has come and taken our loved ones,
It leaves our home so lonely and drear;
Then do we wonder why others prosper,
Living so wicked year after year.

Faithful till death said our loving Master,
A few more days to labour and wait;
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing,
As we sweep through the beautiful gate.

When we see Jesus coming in glory,
When He comes from His home in the sky;
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion,
We'll understand it all by and by.

More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me. 

    More, more about Jesus,
    More, more about Jesus;
    More of His saving fullness see,
    More of His love who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus, in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

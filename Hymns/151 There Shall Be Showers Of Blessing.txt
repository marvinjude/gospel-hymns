"There shall be showers of blessing:"
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

    Showers of blessing,
    Showers of blessing we need;
    Mercy drops round us are falling,
    But for the showers we plead. 

"There shall be showers of blessing:" –
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

"There shall be showers of blessing:"
Send them upon us O Lord!
Grant to us now a refreshing;
Come, and now honour Thy Word.

"There shall be showers of blessing"
Oh, that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call.

"There shall be showers of blessing,"
If we but trust and obey;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
If we let God have His way.

Sweet is the promise - "I will not forget thee,"
Nothing can molest or turn my soul away;
E'en tho' the night be dark within the valley,
Just beyond is shining an eternal day.

    I will not forget thee or leave thee;
    In my hands I'll hold thee, in my arms I'll fold thee;
    I will not forget thee or leave thee;
    I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.

Trusting the promise - "I will not forget thee,"
Onward will I go with songs of joy and love;
Tho' earth despise me, tho' my friends forsake me,
I shall be remembered in my home above.

When at the golden portals I am standing,
All my tribulations, all my sorrows past,
How sweet to hear the blessed proclamation,
"Enter, faithful servant, welcome home at last!"

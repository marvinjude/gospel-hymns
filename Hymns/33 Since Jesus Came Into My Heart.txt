What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart; 
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

    Since Jesus came into my heart
    Since Jesus came into my heart;
    Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,
    Since Jesus came into my heart

I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray, 
Since Jesus came into my heart; 
And my sins which were many are all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart!
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

There's a light in the valley of death now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart!
And the gates of the City beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart; 
And I'm happy, so happy as onward I go, 
Since Jesus came into my heart.

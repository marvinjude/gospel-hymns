Jesus, send more labourers
For, Lord, we see the need
The land is ready for harvest
The fields are ripe indeed

    Oh Lord, but start with me
    Jesus, begin with me
    Who will go for You, Lord?
    Who will go for You, Lord?
    Here I am, Lord Send me
    Send me, Lord Send me

Lord, we love our country
Countless lives to be won
Jesus, bring revival
That through us Your will be done

Lord, we sense Your moving
Touching our lives with power
We are ready to serve You
To go this day, this hour

Come, Holy Ghost, all-quickening fire,
Come, and my hallowed heart inspire,
Sprinkled with the atoning blood:
Now to my soul Thyself reveal;
Thy mighty working let me feel,
And know that I am born of God.

Humble, and teachable, and mild,
O may I, as a little child,
My lowly Master’s steps pursue;
Be anger to my soul unknown;
Hate, envy, jealousy, be gone!
In love create Thou all things new.

Let earth no more my heart divide,
With Christ may I be crucified,
To Thee with my whole soul aspire;
Dead to the world, and all its toys,
Its idle pomp, and fading joys,
Be Thou alone my one desire.

My will be swallowed up in Thee;
Light in Thy light still may I see,
Beholding Thee with open face:
Called the full power of faith to prove,
Let all my hallowed heart be love,
And all my sinless life be praise.

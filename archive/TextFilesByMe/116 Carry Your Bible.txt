Carry your Bible with you,
Let all its blessings outflow;
It will supply you each moment,
Take it wherever you go.

    Take it wherever you go,
    Take it wherever you go,
    God’s message of love,
    Sent down from above,
    O take it wherever you go.

Carry the word of pardon,
Sweeter each day it will grow;
Somewhere some heart will be waiting,
Take it wherever you go.

Carry the wondrous story,
Tell it to hearts plunged in woe;
This word of gracious redemption,
Take it wherever you go. 

Carry the word of promise;
Sinners unpardoned may know
God’s path from sin unto safety,
Take it wherever you go.

Go, labour on, spend, and be spent,
Thy joy to do the Father's will;
It is the way the Master went,
Should not the servant tread it still?

Go, labour on; 'tis not for nought,
Thy earthly loss is heav'nly gain;
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not,
The Master praises, what are men?

Men die in darkness at your side,
Without a hope to cheer the tomb:
Take up the torch, and wave it wide,
The torch that lights time's thickest gloom.

Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice,
For toil comes rest, for exile home;
Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,
The midnight peal, "Behold, I come!'

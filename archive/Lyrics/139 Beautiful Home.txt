There is a Home eternal,
Beautiful and bright,
Where sweet joys supernal
Never are dimm’d by night;
White-rob’d angels are singing
Ever around the bright throne;
When, O when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?

    Home, Beautiful Home!
    Brigh,t beautiful Home!
    Home, home of our Saviour,
    Bright, beautiful Home!

Flow’rs are ever springing
In that Home so fair,
Thousands of children are singing
Praises to Jesus there;

How they swell the glad anthems
Ever around the bright throne;
When, O when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?

Soon shall I join that anthem,
Far beyond the sky;
Christ became my ransom,
Why should I fear to die?
Soon my eyes shall behold Him
Seated upon the bright throne;
Then, O then shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?

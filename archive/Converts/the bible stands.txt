The Bible stands like a rock undaunted
'Mid the raging storms of time;
Its pages burn with the truth eternal,
And they glow with a light sublime.

The Bible stands tho' the hills may tumble,
It will firmly stand when the earth shall crumble;
I will plant my feet on its firm foundation,
For the Bible stands.

The Bible stands like a mountain tow'ring
Far above the works of men;
Its truth by none ever was refuted,
And destroy it they never can.

The Bible stands and it will for ever,
When the world has passed away;
By inspiration it has been given,
All its precepts I will obey.

The Bible stands ev'ry test we give it,
For its Author is divine;
By grace alone I expect to live it,
And to prove it and make it mine.

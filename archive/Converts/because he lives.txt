God sent His Son – they called Him Jesus, 
He came to love, heal and forgive; 
He lived and died to buy my pardon, 
An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives. 

Because He lives I can face tomorrow, 
Because He lives all fear is gone; 
Because I know He holds the future 
And life is worth the living just because He lives. 

How sweet to hold a newborn baby 
And feel the pride and joy he gives; 
But greater still the calm assurance: 
This child can face uncertain days because Christ lives. 

And then one day I'll cross the river, 
I'll fight life's final war with pain; 
And then, as death gives way to victory, 
I'll see the lights of glory - and I'll know He lives.

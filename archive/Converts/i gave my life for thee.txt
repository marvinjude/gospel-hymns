I gave my life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might'st ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead;
I gave, I gave My life for thee – 
What hast thou giv'n for me?

My Father's house of light,
My glory-circled throne
I left for earthly night,
For wand'rings sad and lone;
I left, I left it all for thee –
Hast thou left aught for me?

I suffered much for thee,
More than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitt'rest agony
To rescue thee from hell;
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee –
What hast thou borne for me?

And I have brought to thee,
Down from My home above,
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and My love;
I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee –
What hast thou brought to Me?

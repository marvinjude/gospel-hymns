Amazing grace! how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me;
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come,
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright, shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise,
Than when we've first begun.

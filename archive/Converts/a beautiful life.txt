Each day I'll do... a golden deed,...
By helping those... who are in need;...
My life on earth... is but a span,...
And so I'll do... the best I can...

Life's evening sun... is sinking low,...
A few more days... and I must go...
To meet the deeds... that I have done,...
Where there will be... no setting sun...

To be a child... of God each day,...
My light must shine... along the way;...
I'll sing His praise... while ages roll,...
And strive to help... some troubled soul...

The only life... that will endure,...
Is one that's kind... and good and pure;...
And so for God... I'll take my stand,...
Each day I'll lend... a helping hand...

I'll help someone... in time of need,...
And journey on... with rapid speed;...
I'll help the sick... and poor and weak,...
And words of kind - ness to them speak...

While going down... life's weary road,...
I'll try to lift... some trav-ler's load;...
I'll try to turn... the night to day,...
Make flowers bloom... along the way...

I'm only human, I'm just a woman
Help me believe in what I could be
And all that I am
Show me the stairway, I have to climb
Lord for my sake, teach me to take
One day at a time


One day at a time sweet Jesus
 That's all I'm asking from you
 Just give me the strength
 To do everyday what I have to do
 Yesterdays gone sweet Jesus
 And tomorrow may never be mine
 Lord help me today, show me the way
One day at a time


Do you remember, when you walked among men
Well Jesus you know if you're looking below
It's worse now, than then
Cheating and stealing, violence and crime
So for my sake, teach me to take
One day at a time

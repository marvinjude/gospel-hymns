Down at the cross where the Saviour died,
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
There to my heart was the blood applied –
Glory to His name.

Glory to His name,
Glory to His name,
There to my heart was the blood applied –
Glory to His name.

I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within;
There at the cross where He took me in –
Glory to His name.

O precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean –
Glory to His name.

Come to this fountain so rich and sweet,
Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet;
Plunge in today and be made complete –
Glory to His name.

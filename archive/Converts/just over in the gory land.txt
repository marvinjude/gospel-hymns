I've a home prepared where the saints abide,
Just over in the glory land;
And I long to be by my Saviour's side,
Just over in the glory land. 

Just over in the glory land,
I'll join the happy angel band,
Just over in the glory land;
Just over in the glory land,
There with the mighty host I'll stand,
Just over in the glory land.

I am on my way to those mansions fair,
Just over in the glory land;
There to sing God's praise and His glory share,
Just over in the glory land.

What a joyful thought that my Lord I'll see,
Just over in the glory land;
And with kindred saved, there forever be,
Just over in the glory land.

With the blood-washed throng I will shout and sing,
Just over in the glory land;
Glad hosannas to Christ, the Lord and King,
Just over in the glory land.

My faith looks up to thee, 
Thou Lamb of Calvary, 
Saviour divine! 
Now hear me while I pray, 
Take all my guilt away, 
O let me from this day 
Be wholly Thine!

May thy rich grace impart 
Strength to my fainting heart, 
My zeal inspire! 
As thou hast died for me, 
O may my love to thee 
Pure, warm, and changeless be, 
A living fire! 

While life's dark maze I tread, 
And griefs around me spread, 
Be thou my guide; 
Bid darkness turn to day, 
Wipe sorrow's tears away, 
Nor let me ever stray 
From thee aside. 

When ends life's transient dream, 
When death's cold, sullen stream 
Shall o'er me roll; 
Blest Saviour, then in love, 
Fear and distrust remove; 
O bear me safe above, 
A ransomed soul!

We are one in the Spirit,
We are one in the Lord,
We are one in the Spirit,
We are one in the Lord,
And we pray that all unity
May one day be restored.

And they'll know we are Christians
By our love, by our love,
Yes, they'll know we are Christians
By our love.

We will walk with each other,
We will walk hand in hand,
We will walk with each other,
We will walk hand in hand,
And together we'll spread the news
That God is in our land.

We will work with each other,
We will work side by side
We will work with each other,
We will work side by side
And we'll guard each one's dignity
And save each one's pride.

All praise to the Father
From whom all things come,
And all praise to Christ Jesus His only Son,
And all praise to the Spirit
Who makes us all one.

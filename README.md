## Motivation

Several years ago, I became curious about the inner workings of apps, particularly the hymns app frequently used in my church. After exploring the app, I discovered the phone number of the developer and decided to call him to learn more. Despite the explanations he provided, I didn't fully understand them at the time.

Fast forward to 2019, and I am now a software engineer. I have the skills and knowledge to not only build my own apps, but to also empower other developers to do the same. This is a personal accomplishment that I am proud of. ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Š

## API rate limit

The API at `https://gospel-hymns.onrender.com/api/v1` is rate limited to **100 API calls/15mins**
so the API can't be accessed once the API client exceeds that.

## How JSON is generated

The database(`content/db.json`) is just a JSON file generated by parsing each text file in the **Hymns** directory. Each file represents a hymn. Let's have a look at two of those files for example

**Hymn with chorus:**

```txt
Is there a heart o'er-bound by sorrow?
Is there a life weighed down by care?
Come to the cross--each burden bearing,
All your anxiety--leave it there.

    All your anxiety, all your care,
    Bring to the mercy seat--leave it there;
    Never a burden He cannot bear,
    Never a friend like Jesus.

No other friend so keen to help you,
No other friend so quick to hear;
No other place to leave your burden,
No other one to hear your prayer.

Come then at once--delay no longer!
Heed His entreaty kind and sweet;
You need not fear a disappointment--
You shall find peace at the mercy seat.
```

**Hymn without chorus:**

```txt
'Tis finished! the Messiah dies,
cut off for sins, but not his own.
Accomplished is the sacrifice,
the great redeeming work is done.

The veil is rent; in Christ alone
the living way to heaven is seen;
the middle wall is broken down,
and all the world may enter in.

'Tis finished! All my guilt and pain,
I want no sacrifice beside;
for me, for me the Lamb is slain;
'tis finished! I am justified.

The reign of sin and death is o'er,
and all may live from sin set free;
Satan hath lost his mortal power;
'tis swallowed up in victory.
```

You would notice a few patterns from those files

- Each verse in a hymn is separated with a line
- Each line in a chorus is preceeded with four lines

Watching for that pattern, a JSON file `content/db.json` is generated from the hymns. You can take a look of `makeDB.js` to see how `content/db.json` is generated. `categories.js` and `sounds.js` maps a category to hymn numbers and holds the URL to the sound respectively for each hymn . This is also used while generating `content/db.json`.

## Issue

**A few sounds are missing!! Yes i know. I'll add them once I get it.**

If you find any other issue or some typo in the hymns, you can contact me or edit the associated hymn in the `Hymns` directory and open a PR. Once merged, a new json file will be generated for use by the API and can also be downloaded [here](https://gospel-hymns.onrender.com/downloads)
